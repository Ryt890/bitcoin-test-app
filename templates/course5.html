        <h2>Blockchain Technology</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>Blockchain technology is the backbone of Bitcoin, providing a secure and decentralized ledger that records all transactions.</h3>
        <h3>At its core, blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a group of transactions and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, linking them together.</h3>
        <h3>This linking ensures the immutability of the data — once recorded, information in any block cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks, which requires immense computational power.</h3>
        <h3>The blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network of nodes that collectively validate and store the entire ledger, making it resilient against attacks or single points of failure.</h3>
        <h3>When a user initiates a transaction, it is broadcast to the network, where miners compete to confirm and bundle these transactions into new blocks through a process called proof-of-work.</h3>
        <h3>Proof-of-work involves solving complex mathematical puzzles, which requires significant computational effort, thus securing the network against fraudulent activity.</h3>
        <h3>The first miner to solve the puzzle broadcasts their block to the network, where other nodes verify its validity and add it to their copies of the blockchain.</h3>
        <h3>This consensus mechanism ensures that the majority of the network agrees on the current state of the ledger without relying on a central authority.</h3>
        <h3>Because the blockchain is distributed across thousands of nodes worldwide, it is highly transparent and resistant to censorship or manipulation.</h3>
        <h3>Each block contains a timestamp and a reference to the previous block’s hash, forming a chronological and cryptographically linked record of all transactions ever made on the Bitcoin network.</h3>
        <h3>This structure makes Bitcoin a trustless system — users do not need to trust any individual or institution because the protocol and cryptography enforce honesty.</h3>
        <h3>Beyond Bitcoin, blockchain technology has inspired innovations like smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with terms directly written into code.</h3>
        <h3>Smart contracts enable automatic, transparent, and tamper-proof execution of agreements without intermediaries.</h3>
        <h3>Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms use blockchain to offer financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional banks or brokers.</h3>
        <h3>Supply chain management has also benefited from blockchain by improving transparency and traceability, allowing consumers to verify the origin and journey of products.</h3>
        <h3>Despite its advantages, blockchain technology faces challenges including scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory uncertainty.</h3>
        <h3>Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus consumes substantial electricity, raising environmental concerns and motivating the search for more energy-efficient alternatives.</h3>
        <h3>Alternatives like proof-of-stake reduce energy use by selecting validators based on their stake in the network rather than computational work.</h3>
        <h3>Scalability remains an issue, as Bitcoin’s transaction throughput is limited compared to traditional payment systems, prompting developments like the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper payments.</h3>
        <h3>Regulators around the world are still grappling with how to approach blockchain and cryptocurrencies, balancing innovation with security and consumer protection.</h3>
        <h3>Understanding blockchain technology is crucial for grasping Bitcoin’s security, transparency, and decentralized nature.</h3>
        <h3>It represents a transformative way to store and verify data across distributed networks without centralized control.</h3>
        <h3>By learning about blockchain, you gain insight into the future of finance, governance, and many other fields undergoing digital transformation.</h3>

          Bitcoin uses cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures and hashing to ensure that transactions are authentic and tamper-proof.
          Its decentralized network means no single entity controls the ledger; instead, multiple independent nodes validate transactions collectively, making fraud or censorship extremely difficult.
          This combination creates a trustless system where security comes from math and network consensus, not from a central authority.
