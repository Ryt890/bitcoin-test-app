            <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Bitcoin is more than just a digital currency — it’s a groundbreaking financial innovation built on computer science, cryptography, and economics.</h3>
            <h3>At its core, Bitcoin is a decentralized, public ledger system known as the blockchain. This ledger records all transactions ever made using Bitcoin, and it's maintained by a global network of computers, not by any single authority or government.</h3>
            <h3>Unlike traditional currencies issued by central banks, Bitcoin is not printed or created at will. It follows a strict set of rules encoded in software, ensuring that only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist. This scarcity makes Bitcoin resistant to inflation and has led many to compare it to digital gold.</h3>
            <h3>Every time a user sends bitcoin to someone else, that transaction is broadcast to the network. Instead of a central bank verifying the transaction, thousands of independent computers (called nodes) work together to validate it. Once verified, the transaction is added to a “block,” and that block is linked to the previous one — forming the chain of blocks, or blockchain.</h3>
            <h3>One of the most revolutionary aspects of Bitcoin is its decentralization. There’s no CEO of Bitcoin, no office, and no shutdown switch. Anyone can participate in the network, view the code, or even contribute to its development. This open structure gives power back to individuals and removes the need for trusted third parties like banks or payment processors.</h3>
            <h3>Security is a key feature of Bitcoin. Every transaction is protected by cryptographic signatures and backed by the collective computing power of miners worldwide. Once a transaction is confirmed and added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, making fraud extremely difficult.</h3>
            <h3>Bitcoin is also borderless. It doesn’t care where you live, what language you speak, or what country you’re in. As long as you have internet access and a digital wallet, you can send or receive Bitcoin anytime, anywhere — often faster and cheaper than traditional bank transfers.</h3>
            <h3>But Bitcoin is more than just money. It represents an idea: that people should have full control over their own assets without relying on centralized institutions. It’s about financial freedom, transparency, and trustless systems that rely on math and code rather than human authority.</h3>
            <h3>In developing countries, where access to banks is limited and inflation can erode savings quickly, Bitcoin offers an alternative way to store value and participate in the global economy. In free societies, it challenges traditional models and empowers people to rethink what money really is.</h3>
            <h3>Ultimately, Bitcoin is an experiment — one that’s already survived for over a decade. It’s still evolving, still controversial, but it has already changed how millions of people think about money. Whether it becomes a global currency or not, its impact on technology, finance, and society is undeniable.</h3>

        Bitcoin's decentralization means that no single entity or authority controls the network. Instead, it is maintained by a global network of independent participants (nodes) that validate and record transactions. This is important because it increases security, transparency, and trustlessness, making the system resistant to censorship, fraud, and centralized control.
